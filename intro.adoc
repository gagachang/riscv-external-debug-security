== Introduction
Debugging and tracing are essential tools utilized by developers to identify and rectify software and hardware issues, optimize performance, and ensure robust system functionality. The debugging and tracing extensions in RISC-V ecosystem play a pivotal role in enabling these capabilities, allowing developers to monitor and control the execution of programs during the development and testing phases. However, ensuring the security of this interface is of paramount importance to prevent unauthorized access and potential security breaches. Without adequate security measures, these functions can be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access, compromise system integrity, and extract sensitive information. 

The extension is complementary to RISC-V Debug Specification and Efficient Trace for RISC-V, ensuring robust security. It comprises of ISA part and non-ISA part. The ISA part defines the enhancement inside the hart while the non-ISA part enforces the security rules on Debug Module.
