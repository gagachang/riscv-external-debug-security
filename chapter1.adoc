== External Debug Security Threat model

RISC-V defines several privilege levels that are referred to as machine mode (M-mode), supervisor mode (S-mode), user mode (U-mode). Additionally, hypervisor extension changes the supervisor mode into hypervisor-extended supervisor mode (HS-mode) and further introduces virtual supervisor mode (VS-mode) as well as virtual user mode (VU-mode). The availability of privilege levels may vary cross different RISC-V implementations

Numerous Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) architectures leverage the RISC-V privileged software stack. The following <<opmodel>> serves as an illustrative operating model. Within this model, the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) consists of the M-mode secure monitor, and secured partitions, which are prohibited from debugging.

The Debug Module and trace module are identified as potential attackers within the scope of this extension. The STRIDE threat model, presented in the <<stridetb>>, illustrates the attack vectors associated with each module. The considered attack scenarios include debuggable partitions targeting the M-mode secure monitor and other secured, non-debuggable partitions. Given that the Debug Module's capabilities is beyond M-mode, it can potentially execute attacks including:

- Spoofing 
- Tampering
- Repudiation
- Information Disclosure
- Denial of Service
- Elevation of Privilege

Additionally, the trace module poses a risk of disclosing confidential information. However, the extension outlined in this specification aims to mitigate these attack vectors.
